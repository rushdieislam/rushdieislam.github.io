	Our research group primarily works in the area of computational solid mechanics. 
	We use computational methods, such as the finite element method, to solve practical 
	problems in the field of mechanical sciences. The current focus areas of our research are mentioned below.
	<b>Please click on each focus area for details.</b>
    <br><br>
	<b>Note:</b> The commentary on these focus areas is written with undergraduate and entry-level 
	graduate students in mind. Experts may occasionally find the commentary overly simplistic.

			It is well-known and widely recognized in the fatigue community that a material's 
			internal structure significantly influences its fatigue characteristics. Although 
			the SN diagram and Paris' law are extremely popular in fatigue design, these empirical 
			models do not explicitly account for the material's internal structure. The goal of 
			microstructure-sensitive fatigue modeling is to provide a bottom-up simulation framework 
			that can predict emerging deformation and damage characteristics based on a material's 
			given microstructure. Applications of such a framework include, but are not limited to, 
			the integrated design of materials and parts for safety-critical applications, 
			accelerated material qualification, and prognosis.
			<br><br>
			The figure below summarizes the major activities involved in microstructure-sensitive 
			fatigue modeling. There are research and collaboration opportunities available in each 
			highlighted area. If you are interested in exploring this field, please refer to the paper 
			cited beneath the image. If you do not have access to the paper and need a copy, feel free 
			to email Dr. Ritwik Bandyopadhyay.

    <div id="thrust2" class="thrust-content">
        <p>
			Imagine there are two identical-looking engineering components, such as turbine discs. 
			Both are produced via forging, but one undergoes additional heat treatment. As an engineer, 
			you intuitively know that although the two discs appear the same, their mechanical performance 
			will differ due to their different internal states. If you perform a stress analysis using FEA 
			software without considering the initial internal state, the prediction will be significantly off. 
			Therefore, it is essential to accurately initialize the internal state within the simulation framework. 
			But what is the internal state, and how do we initialize it?
			<br><br>
			In simple stress analysis, the internal state refers to residual stress. In more complex models, 
			the internal state can include factors such as dislocation density and intragranular misorientation.
			<br><br>
			Our group focuses on modeling residual stress at different material length scales, incorporating it 
			into simulation frameworks, identifying optimal locations for residual stress measurements in 
			engineering components, and designing new technologies to induce location-specific residual stress 
			for targeted mechanical performance.
			<br><br>
			If you are new to the concept of residual stress, you may read the papers by Withers and Bhadeshia 
			(paper 1, paper 2). For a deeper understanding, refer to the paper cited below the image. You are 
			always welcome to contact our group leader if you want to discuss this topic further.

        <p>
			Have you heard the quote, "All models are wrong, but some are useful"? This idea, often 
			attributed to British statistician George E. P. Box, highlights that no model is completely 
			accurate because it is a simplification of reality; some information is always lost. 
			If nothing were lost, the model would be an exact copy, not a model.
			<br><br>
			In our group, we approach modeling and simulation with this humility. We not only predict values, 
			such as stress concentration and fatigue life, but also quantify the associated uncertainty, 
			which can be thought of as a prediction interval or a probability distribution.
			<br><br>
			In our modeling and simulation activities, we consider the following questions:
			<ol>
				<li>
					Can we precisely measure or calibrate the model's parameter values? 
					If not, can we determine the probability distributions for these parameters?
				</li>

				<li>
					Knowing the model parameters are random variables, can we propagate their 
					distributions through simulations to characterize the probability distribution 
					of the output variables?
				</li>

				<li>
					Among multiple mathematical models describing the same physical phenomenon, 
					can we identify which model leads to the least prediction uncertainty?
				</li>
			</ol>
			We address these questions using various probabilistic methods. We take uncertainty quantification and propagation seriously, aiming to translate the tools and frameworks developed in our lab for practical applications.
