	<h1>Grading</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Quiz: 15%</li>
		<li>Minor: 15%</li>
		<li>Major: 30%</li>
		<li>Project: 30%</li>
		<li>Literature review: 10%</li>
	</ul>
	If a student decides to audit the course, the passing grade will be 40%.
	Additionally, the student must write the major exam, submit the project, and the attendance 
	must be greater than or equal to 75%.

	<h1>Quizzes, midterm and major</h1>
	Two quizzes will be conducted; exact date, time and place will be notified later. 
	Midterm and major exams will be scheduled based on the institute timetable.

	<h1>Homework</h1>
	Homework will be assigned almost every week. These will not be graded. Hence, submission is not necessary.
	However, students are strongly encouraged to try the homework problems independently as these will prepapre
	them for the quizzes, minor, and major exams.

	<h1>Literature review</h1>
	<h3>Selecting a research paper</h3>
	Choose a research paper from a reputed journal. 
	Below is a list of suggested journals; however, you are free to select from other reputable journals as well:
	<ul>
		<li>International Journal of Fatigue</li>
		<li>Acta Materialia</li>
		<li>International Journal of Plasticity</li>
		<li>Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids</li>
		<li>Proceedings of the Royal Society A</li>
		<li>npj Computational Materials</li>
	</ul>
	The chosen paper should focus on a topic related to fatigue but must not be a review article.
	<h3>Suggested topics</h3>
	While you may select any topic related to fatigue, here are some suggestions for guidance:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Environmental effects on fatigue</b>: Includes thermomechanical fatigue, corrosion, and irradiation effects.</li>
		<li><b>Application of advanced experimental methods to study fatigue damage</b>: Techniques such as high-resolution digital image correlation (HR-DIC), high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy (HEDM), and diffraction contrast tomography (DCT).</li>
		<li><b>Advanced computational methods for fatigue modeling</b>: Includes crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE), molecular dynamics (MD), field dislocation mechanics (FDM), discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD), and discrete dislocation plasticity (DDP).</li>
		<li><b>AI/ML in fatigue</b>: Includes discovery of fatigue driving mechanisms, fatigue life prediction, reduced-order modeling, etc.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Key focus areas while reading the paper</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Key contributions</b>: What are the main findings and advancements presented in the paper?</li>
		<li><b>Novelty</b>: What makes the approach or findings unique?</li>
		<li><b>Limitations</b>: Are there any limitations in the research?</li>
		<li><b>Future potential</b>: What are the opportunities for extending or applying the work?</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Presentation</h3>
	You will deliver a 10 to 15-minute presentation on your selected paper. 
	The presentation should focus on the key contributions, novelty, limitations, and potential future work of the paper.
	<h3>Deadline</h3>
	Finalize the research paper for review by <b>24th January 2025</b>.

	<h1>Project</h1>
	The detailed instructions and associated deadline will be provided soon.

	<h1>Attendance</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Students are strongly encouraged to attend all the lectures. 
			Attendance will be recorded for each lecture. If a student's 
			attendance is less than 75%, the student will be awarded one grade less than the actual 
			grade that he/she has earned. For example, a student who has got an A grade but has 
			attendance less than 75% will be awarded an A (-) grade. However, please note that 
			there are no marks for attendance. 
		</li>

		<li>
			In case of absence due to unforeseen circumstances, 
			such as medical reasons, the student must inform the instructor 
			via email within a week from the date of absence.
		</li>

		<li>
			If a student cannot appear for an exam due to medical reasons, 
			a medical certificate needs to be 
			produced from IIT Delhi hospital for consideration of time 
			extension or re-exam.
		</li>
	</ul>
