	<h1>Grading</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Midterm: 30%</li>
		<li>Major: 30%</li>
		<li>Homework: 10%</li>
		<li>Project: 30%</li>
	</ul>
	If a student decides to audit the course, the passing grade will be 40%.
	Additionally, the project needs to be completed, the student must appear
	for midterm and major exams, and the attendance must be greater than or 
	equal to 75%.

	<h1>Midterm and major</h1>
	Midterm and major exams will be scheduled based on the institute timetable. 

	<h1>Homework</h1>
	Tentatively <u>Five</u> homework will be assigned, and the <u>best four</u> 
	will be counted toward the grade. The due date will be mentioned (typically 
	two weeks from the day of posting) in each homework assignment. Late submission 
	will only be accepted with prior consent from the instructor.

	<h1>Project</h1>
	<i>What to do?</i>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Select a research paper on reliability engineering (preferably 
			related to a topic from the course) <b>OR</b> choose a topic
	    	from reliability engineering (e.g., FOSM, FORM, SORM, etc.).
		</li>

		<li>
			Read the paper, identify the key contribution, and reproduce the
			results <b>OR</b> do a literature survey on the chosen topic.
		</li>

		<li>
			Prepare a report and a powerpoint presentation.
		</li>

		<li>
			Teamwork is not allowed.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<i>Timeline</i>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Submit a draft proposal - a title and an abstract (not exceeding 
			250 words) by <b>25/01/2024</b>.
		</li>

		<li>
			Submit the final proposal - revised title and abstract based on
			feedback by <b>08/02/2024</b>.
		</li>

		<li>
			Submit a progress report in the prescribed format 
			(to be provided) by <b>21/03/2024</b>.
		</li>

		<li>
			Submit the final report and a 
			powerpoint presentation by <b>18/04/2024</b>.
			<ul>
				<li>
					The main report should be at most <u>four</u> pages (A4 page, 11 pt font
					size, single spacing, 2.54 cm margin on all sides).
				</li>
				<li>
					Additional items, such as codes, derivations, etc., can be
					provided in the appendix.
				</li>
				<li>
					The student should present the work for about 10 minutes. The date and time will be notified later.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>Attendance</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Students are strongly encouraged to attend all the lectures. 
			Attendance will be recorded for each class. Although there are no
		    marks for attendance, one grade will be lowered if the overall 
			attendance is below 75%.
		</li>

		<li>
			In case of absence due to unforeseen circumstances, 
			such as medical reasons, the student must inform the instructor 
			via email within a week from the date of absence.
		</li>

		<li>
			If a student cannot submit homework/project or appear for the exam 
			due to medical reasons, a medical certificate needs to be 
			produced from IIT Delhi hospital for consideration of time 
			extension or re-exam.
		</li>
