	<h1>Grading</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Quiz: 10%</li>
		<li>Homework: 10%</li>
		<li>Minor: 30%</li>
		<li>Major: 50%</li>
		<li>Laboratory (optional): 10%</li>
	</ul>
	If a student decides to audit the course, the passing grade will be 40%.
	Additionally, the student must write minor and major exams, and the attendance 
	must be greater than or equal to 75%.

	<h1>Quizzes, midterm and major</h1>
	One quiz will be conducted; exact date, time and place will be notified later. 
	Midterm and major exams will be scheduled based on the institute timetable.

	<h1>Homework</h1>
	If <i>n</i> homework are assigned, best <i>n-1</i> will be counted toward the grade. 
	The due date will be mentioned (typically one week from the day of posting) in each homework assignment. 
	Late submission will only be accepted with prior consent from the instructor. Moodle will be used for homework assignment and submission.

	<h1>Laboratory (optional)</h1>
	According to the current credit structure, APL205 does not include a laboratory component. 
	However, some laboratory exposure is essential for students to fully understand and appreciate 
	the course content. To gauge students' interest in optional laboratory sessions, an online form 
	will be circulated. Additionally, students can earn up to 10 bonus points based on their participation 
	in the laboratory sessions and related assignments.


	<h1>Attendance</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Students are strongly encouraged to attend all the lectures. 
			Attendance will be recorded for each lecture. If a student's 
			attendance is less than 75%, the student will be awarded one grade less than the actual 
			grade that he/she has earned. For example, a student who has got an A grade but has 
			attendance less than 75% will be awarded an A (-) grade. However, please note that 
			there are no marks for attendance. 
		</li>

		<li>
			In case of absence due to unforeseen circumstances, 
			such as medical reasons, the student must inform the instructor 
			via email within a week from the date of absence.
		</li>

		<li>
			If a student cannot appear for an exam due to medical reasons, 
			a medical certificate needs to be 
			produced from IIT Delhi hospital for consideration of time 
			extension or re-exam.
		</li>
